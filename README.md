# PySnake
#simple, beginer friendly snake game
#move the snake with W, A, S, D keys(also covered by a temporary info-menu at the begining of the game)
#extrafood will be spawned at 50, 150
#with every bite the snake will grow and the speed will increase
#any collision with the walls or the snake's body(including driving the head into its first segment) will get you a flickering "Game Over"
